# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
# Overview
This project is designed to harvest and warehouse YouTube data using Python programming language, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit. The goal is to collect, store, and analyze YouTube data for various purposes such as content recommendation, trend analysis, and user behavior insights.
# Tools Used
Python Programming Language: Python is used for its versatility, ease of use, and a rich ecosystem of libraries, making it suitable for web scraping, data processing, and analysis.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is employed as the relational database management system (RDBMS) to store structured data efficiently. It provides ACID compliance and supports complex queries.

MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database to store semi-structured and unstructured data. Its flexible schema and scalability make it suitable for handling diverse types of data.

Streamlit: Streamlit is utilized for building interactive and customizable web-based data dashboards. It allows for easy visualization of the harvested YouTube data.
